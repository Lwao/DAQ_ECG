\textbf{\Large Abstract}
\end{center}

Regarding the importance of the Electrocardiograph (ECG) instrument, this work tends to develop an experimental setup for a data acquisition system to collect ECG signals. Also all steps in the development are explicated so readers and scholars can base their prototypes with high level of details in the system specification and sizing. This platform is built with an ECG simulator in software and hardware domain; an analog front-end to adequate the acquired ECG signal from the source; and a digital interface with an ESP32 controller to post process the signal, analyse heart rate and pathologies and transmit the final ECG to other means of visualization. Also many software routines are developed so tests can also be performed in a high level of abstraction.
