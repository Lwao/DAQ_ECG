\section{Conclusions}

The developed DAQ, besides its limitations, performed a very well job, extracting the ECG and heart rate information for pathology analysis.

The software and hardware platform allows a deeper understanding on how the system works. The high level of abstraction software has ECG simulation that helps to validate the digital signal processing algorithms before deploying in the hardware. Thus the hardware has its limitations and challenges, allowing to adapt the algorithms to a lower level of abstraction point-of-view.

In general this work indexes various detailed steps about the embedded hardware development, aiming to help researches to extract a deeper meaning of its tools.
